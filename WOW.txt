Is the life of a person similar to that of a tree,
a tree starts it's life from nowhere, and goes to
place as high and stiff as it could, but is that 
good enough, I mean with good health and nourishment
anyhting can find great success. Then is the weed 
better than tree since it grows with any help or
extra nourishment?
